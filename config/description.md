We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data.

This analysis focuses on just West African clade viruses. For molecular clock analyses we assume an evolutionary rate of 5 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> (following estimates of variola virus from [Firth et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3107591/)). We are masking several regions of the genome, including the first 1500 and last 1000 bases and a repetitive region of variable length.
